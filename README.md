### 2048 recreated in React
 2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.[5] Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided
